# Optional: minimum job size
# if job "my-db-job-name" is ok and its size is less than the defined one, mark the job as "ATTENTION" in the report.  This is expecially useful for jobs
# with a pre-script that dump a database: the script may return with ok value (0) but it didn't dump the databases. This feature will make easier
# to detect this dangerous behaviour.
# You can define as many minimum-size-definition as you want.
#
# If you don't need this feature, you can simply comment that lines
#
# job "my-db-job-name" size must be more than 900Mb (size must be expressed in bytes)
